# The left-hand side of the equation (Presentation)


## A

Consider an 7 category, ordinal outcome Y and continuous predictor X.  When X=0, the distribution of Y is as follows:


| k | $P(Y=k \| X = 0)$ |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 0.008 |
| 2 | 0.162 |
| 3 | 0.323 |
| 4 | 0.269 |
| 5 | 0.149 |
| 6 | 0.065 |
| 7 | 0.024 |


Under the assumption that the log relative odds is linear in X, calculate an expression for $f(x) = P(Y=k|X=x)$.  In your presentation, explain how you derived $f(x)$.  (Hint: Chapters 13 and 15 in Regression Modeling Strategies may be helpful.)

## B

Generate an interactive figure to illustrate how the conditional distribution of $Y$, $P(Y=k|X)$, changes as $X$ changes.

## C

Suppose X and Y are continuous random variables, and

$$
    Y|X = 0 \sim \text{GAMMA}(\text{shape}=5, \text{rate}=12)
$$

Assuming that the log relative hazard is linear in X, calculate an expression for the density and cumulative probability functions of $Y|X$.  (Hint: Chapters 17 to 20 in Regression Modeling Strategies may be helpful.)

## D

Generate an interactive figure to illustrate how the conditional distribution $Y|X$ changes as $X$ changes.

## F

Identify an example in the literature of modeling using the log relative hazard.  Summarize the primary outcome and primary research question.

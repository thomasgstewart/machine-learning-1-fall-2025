# Machine Learning I Fall 2025

## Big Ideas

This course is organized around a few big ideas.

1. Model building is inherently an exercise in structured information sharing

![](./assets/sharing.png)

2. Linear model ≠ Linear relationships
3. Constraints = Information
4. Variability in data → Variability in models → Variability in predictions and inference

## Topical learning objectives

![](./assets/course-organization.png)

* Construct glm, semi-parametric, and ensemble models which 
    * answer research questions
    * allow for nonlinearity
    * incorporation interactions
* Calculate in-sample and out-of-sample measures of performance
    * Describe the relationships between model complexity, stability, and generalizability 
* Assess model fit
* Visualize the relationships implied by the various models
* Implement different types of regularization/constraints
    * PCA, L1, L2, Bayesian

## Professional learning objectives

* Use reproducible reporting tools (notebooks, markdown, etc)
* Use Github
* Author comprehensive reports and associated manuscripts which
    * Translate the research question to analytic methods
        * Identify simplifying assumptions and consequences
    * Describe data collection, provenance, and processing
    * Include consort diagram
    * Include standard summaries of population/data (Table 1)
    * Include publication-ready figures and tables
* Prepare oral or poster presentations which are tailored to the intended audience

## Instructional approach

Among other things, 

* This is a **writing** course.  Nearly every assignment and class period will involve a writing component.
* This is a **self-directed** course.  Students are encouraged to identify and pursue topics of personal interest related to the learning objectives.
* This is a **reading** course.  Students are expected to pursue topics of personal interest by finding and reading scholarly texts.
* This is a **get-your-hands-dirty** course.  Students are expected to demonstrate ideas and tools with reproducible examples and simulations.
* This is a **public speaking** course.  Students are expected to present to the class regularly.

## Cadence

Generally, each module will be assigned at the end of class on Tuesday.  On Thursdays, class will begin with student presentations on initial explorations of the topic, usually with simple examples and applications.  Then, the instructor will lecture.  On Tuesdays, students will present on the topic in greater detail and rigor, possibly including self-directed (but related) topics.

| | Thursday | Tuesday |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| First half | Initial explorations (less formal) |  Student presentations (more formal) |
| Second half | Lecture | Student presentations (more formal) |

## Final projects

Students will plan, execute, and present an evaluation of methods, typically using simulation.  Students will propose the topic of evaluation; the instructor will approve the topics, providing guidance if revision is needed.

The final exam period is Monday, December 15, 2025 from 9AM to noon.  During the exam period, students will present their evaluations.

## Evaluation

Final grades will be a weighted average of the final project (30%), initial explorations (30%), and student presentations (40%).

| Grade | Score |
|---|---|
| A | [90, 100] |
| B | [80, 90) |
| C | [70, 80) |
| F | Otherwise |

## Communication

To be discussed on first day of class.

## Adjustments

The instructor may alter the course content and grading policies during the semester.

## Collaborative learning

Students are encouraged to study together.  The instructions for each deliverable will indicate if and how students may work together on the deliverable.
Students should not collaborate on the final project.  Students that violate the collaborative-work policy on an deliverable will fail the deliverable in
question and forfeit the opportunity to retake or resubmit.  Students that violate the collaborative-work policy on the final exam will fail the final exam.
Students may be refered to UVA Honor Committee.

## Accomodations

UVA is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC), to request an official accommodation. You can find more information about SDAC, including how to apply online, through their website at www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please make sure to send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.
